<p>Oh, hi.<br>
This is my personal blog, er... website, as I call.
</p>
<p>It is optimised to use minimal resource, which means it's only made up of HTML and CSS. No Javascript, no fancy designs, and no icons/images except in posts. Just a light-weight, minimal page.
</p>
<p>And it's self-contained, so there's little to no external dependencies. Web fonts will be inside the repository, etc.
</p>
<p>As of now I'm writing all of these by hand. Yeah, crazy, I know.<br>
I may end up using those Static Site Generators, but I'm using this opportunity to learn deeply about HTML5 and CSS.
</p>
<p>Anyways, enjoy your micro-stay here.</p>
<p>(P.S. If you're still not aware of it, this site is under <s>active</s> development. Please be patient...)</p>
